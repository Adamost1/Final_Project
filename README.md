# Magnetic Flux Simulator with loops of wire and a uniform magnetic field(Aidan Griffin, Alvin Ye)
Our project is a simulation of how a EMF(and consequently current) is induced in a loop of wire moving through a magnetic field.  
The project features a rectangular loop of wire (of negligible diameter) that is perpendicular to a rectangular region of constant magnetic field.
First, type in whatever value you want for the magnetic field and press enter whenever you are confident. You can always press shift to reset to the beginning or backspace to delete your current value only.
If you try to type in a letter or any other non-number or decimal point character, it will fail. 
Next, you type in the length and width of the rectangular loop of wire as well as the number of loops of wire you want. Press enter after each value is entered.
After that you can start dragging the loop of wire into the magnetic field and there will be red triangles for a counterclockwise direction of current and blue triangles for a clockwise direction of motion with both sets of triangles pointing in those directions respectively.
Lastly, on the top left hand corner of the screen, there is a blue toggle button that can changed the direction of the magnetic field from into the page to out of the page and vice versa. 
Happy Simulating!
